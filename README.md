# Project Title

FPGA-GPU

This project is a work in progress attempting to create a simple GPU using a low-budget FPGA while still having the fundemental structure designs of modern GPUs.

## Getting Started

This project is built on the Altera De1-SoC-MLT2 Board. Download the .sv files and compile them on Quartus II, the Altera IDE
to run the program properly.

### Prerequisites

Proper installation of Quartus II/[Quartus Prime](https://www.altera.com/downloads/download-center.html)

[Altera De1-SoC-MLT2 Board](https://www.altera.com/content/dam/altera-www/global/en_US/portal/dsn/42/doc-us-dsnbk-42-4207350307415-de1-soc-mtl2-user-manual.pdf)


## Built With

* [Quartus Prime](https://www.altera.com/downloads/download-center.html)

## Versioning

Work in progress. Currently implementing GPU math functions (rotation, 3D-2D perspective transform etc.) in GPU functions.sv
