# Project Title

FPGA-GPU

This project is a work in progress attempting to create a simple GPU using a low-budget FPGA while still having the fundemental structure designs of modern GPUs.

## Getting Started

This project is built on the Altera De1-SoC-MLT2 Board. Download the .sv files and compile them on Quartus II, the Altera IDE
to run the program properly.
